# Pwn3rd-Wallpaper
My personal collection of 4k wallpapers. Works great on all desktop environments, and that fits nice to tiling window managers, like Hyprland, i3wm, Sway, etc.

## Installation

Clone the directory from your home directory.
```
cd ~/Pictures # You can also choose a different location
git clone https://github.com/DeepN3rd/Pwn3rd-Wallpaper.git
cd /../Pwn3rd-Wallpaper/
```
Enjoy !

You can use apps like `Waypaper`, `Feh`, etc... which allow you to manage and change wallpapers.
Very useful if you use tiling window managers.
